## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media queries

### What I learned

I learned more about media queries, this is my first page where I tried to make it look good in all of the devices that google offers, also I tried the mobile-first workflow for the first time

### Continued development

I would try to be more organized in writting css code, also I need to make more responsive designs.

### Useful resources

- [Slaying The Dragon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K24lUqcT0Ms&t=463s) - This helped me to make a mobile-first workflow and also to understand how media works
